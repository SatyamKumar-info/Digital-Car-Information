            Jaguar is a British luxury car manufacturer known for its elegant design, high-performance vehicles, and rich
            motorsport heritage. It was founded in 1922 as the Swallow Sidecar Company by William Lyons and William Walmsley
            in Blackpool, England. Initially, the company built motorcycle sidecars before transitioning to cars and later
            adopting the Jaguar name in 1945.
