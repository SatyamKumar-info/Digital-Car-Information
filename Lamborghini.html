        <p>Lamborghini, the iconic Italian luxury sports car manufacturer, was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. Initially, Ferruccio made his fortune in the tractor business with Lamborghini Trattori, but he decided to enter the high-performance car market after a dispute with Enzo Ferrari over the quality of Ferrari’s clutches.
