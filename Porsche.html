            Porsche is a German automobile manufacturer known for its high-performance sports cars, luxury SUVs, and sedans.
            The company was founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany as a vehicle development and
            consulting firm. Initially, Porsche did not build its own cars but helped design the Volkswagen Beetle, one of
            the most successful cars in history.
